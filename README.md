# jfx-file-view

This is a small JavaFX project that I'm using to gain experience
with JavaFX.  It is a viewer for large files, that
only holds small blocks of a file in memory at any given time.

## Status

Right now, there is only a skeleton of a project. It's not functional.

## Planned Features

 - Text and HexEdit-style views.
 - Regex Search that finds matches which cross block boundaries
 - User-specified block size
 - Some (not sure how much) user control over formatting in Hex mode

## Kotlin Version

The earliest versions in the repo history were in Kotlin, as I was
also playing with Kotlin at the time, but I've converted it to plain
java now.
